                <article>
                    <p>The Purple Penguin Project was formed in 2010 by the Global Penguin Society, Penguins International, and the World Wildlife Fund. A fifth species of penguin had just been reclassified as endangered, and with the 3 conservation groups already struggling to help the other 4 species, they decided to take action.<br><br>
                    The purpose of the Purple Penguin Project is to raise money to aid in the conservation of endangered penguins. The money is raised through an annual event that is hosted on World Penguin Day (April 25th) at the Tropical Park Stadium in Miami, Florida. All vendors that perform at or provide food during the event volunteer their time and services. All of the money received from the purchase of tickets to the event go to any of the 3 host groups to support them in their penguin conservation efforts.</p>
